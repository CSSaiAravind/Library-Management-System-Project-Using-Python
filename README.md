Library Management Systems are used to manage information about contents in a library. They are used to manage information relating to books, their names, codes, author names, whether they have been issued or not and if so, who has issued them and what their cardâ€™s ID is; a library management system is used to store and manage all this information.
A library management system in Python typically involves functionalities such as adding books, displaying the book list, lending books, and returning books. It can be implemented with or without a graphical user interface (GUI) and may include features like book categorization, user authentication, and database integration for persistent storage. The system aims to streamline library operations, providing efficient book management and user services.
